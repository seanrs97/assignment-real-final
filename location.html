												<h3 class="icon fa fa-book"  aria-hidden="true">Methods of Studying</h3>
												<p>Decide what works best for you when studying. If you're a social person than perhaps working in a group of people will benefit 
												   your learning outcomes, if not then working alone is probably the best way for you. Along with this, you also have the choice of
												   working in a quiet enviroment, or a louder one (perhaps with music?) again, this all comes down to preference, so it really 
												   is up to the indivudal themself.</p></p>

												<h3 class="icon fa fa-tree">Where to Study</h3>
												<p>You pretty much have the world at your oyster when it comes to studying.. but some places are better than others. The library is probably
												   the best place to go, as you'll find most of the resources you need in a quiet enviroment. If however, you prefer your own company, then 
												   study at home if possible! or if it's a nice day, take a stroll and find a nice place to sit and study.</p>

												<h3 class="icon fa fa-times">Things to Avoid</h3>
												<p>Don't overdo or underdo it! Studying is an art that needs to be mastered. It is very easy to commit yourself to a full day of work
												   but in reality, after a few hours, your brain probably would have turned to mush. The same can be said for underdoing work, it is 
												   very important to do work when you have it, or else you're just going to find it harder to complete. So find your balance, and do
												   work in moderation.</p>
											</section>
										</div>
										<div class="6u 12u(mobile)">
											<section>
												<h3 class="icon fa fa-cloud">Some Final Tips</h3>
												<p> Get plenty of rest and don't party before studying! This is probably the worst thing you can do if you have an assignment due soon 
													and have a lot of work to do. Drinking heavy or not sleeping much will not only slow your thought processes, but it will also leave
													you sleepy and drowsy for the forseeing future. So maybe save the partying and late nights for when you're in the clear on your 
													assignments.</p>
